## 1. Project Overview:

I worked on a project using Power BI to transform raw data into valuable insights. The project involved importing data, cleaning and processing it, applying calculations, and creating an interactive dashboard that visualizes business data.

## 2. Project Objective:
The main objective of the project was to import data into Power BI, clean and process it, apply calculations using DAX, create meaningful visualizations, and design a dynamic dashboard that could deliver business insights.

## 3. Key Steps I Followed in the Project:

1. Import Data in Power BI: I began by importing data from various sources into Power BI, making sure to load the data in an appropriate format.

2. Data Cleaning & Processing in Power BI: Using Power Query Editor, I cleaned the data, handling missing values, errors, and performing necessary data transformations to ensure it was ready for analysis.

3. Power Query Editor in Power BI: I utilized the Power Query Editor to refine and shape the dataset, ensuring that it met the analysis requirements.

4. DAX in Power BI: I applied DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform complex calculations and create metrics that enabled deeper insights into the data.

5. Measures and Calculations in Power BI: I created custom measures for key performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics essential for analyzing business performance.

6. Create New Columns and Tables in Power BI: I added calculated columns and tables to enhance the dataset and provide further context for analysis.

7. Advanced Charts and Maps in Power BI: I used advanced charts and map visualizations to display the data in an engaging and informative way.

8. Filters and Slicers in Power BI: I incorporated filters and slicers, enabling users to interact with the data and drill down into specific segments.

9. Zoom in Charts in Power BI: I enabled zoom functionality in the charts, allowing users to get a closer look at specific data points and trends.

10. Dashboard Design in Power BI: I designed a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard that displayed business insights clearly and effectively.

11. Forecasting in Power BI: I applied forecasting techniques to predict future trends and analyzed how these predictions could influence business decisions.

12. Power BI Sales Forecast: I built a sales forecast model that allowed me to predict future sales and forecast business performance.

13. Export Power BI Dashboard: After completing the dashboard, I exported it for sharing with stakeholders and for use in presentations.

14. Insights from Dashboard: I drew actionable insights from the dashboard, providing the business team with valuable information to make data-driven decisions.
